# OompaDB

### First run:
`npm install` when you first download this project. This will install all the node libraries that are missing.


### Running the application:
`npm start` runs the backend and the frontend simultaneously



### Database Setup
create a `.env` file in the server folder and add values for the following:

`MONGODB_USERNAME=XXX`

`MONGODB_PWD=XXX`

### Examples

I have included an `Examples` folder which will make it easier for us to use our custom components
